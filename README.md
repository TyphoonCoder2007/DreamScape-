# 🌌 DreamScape — Interactive Mood Universe

**DreamScape** is an interactive web experience that transforms emotions into living digital worlds.  
Users choose a mood, color palette, and soundscape — and DreamScape creates a unique **3D planet** that visually and musically reflects how they feel.  
It’s where **emotion, art, and technology** come together.

## 🎨 Features

- 🪐 Generate a **3D mood planet** based on user emotions  
- 🎧 Real-time **sound visualization** using the Web Audio API  
- 🌈 Dynamic **colors, lighting, and atmosphere** based on moods  
- 💫 Smooth animations powered by Three.js and GLSL shaders  
- 💾 Save or share your custom planet via encoded URL  
- 📱 Responsive and lightweight — runs directly in the browser

## 🧠 Inspiration

DreamScape was inspired by the idea that emotions could shape the universe around us.  
I wanted to connect **human feeling** with **creative technology** — turning moods into mini-universes that breathe and respond to sound.
