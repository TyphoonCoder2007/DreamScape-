Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas of AI in healthcare. Here are some of the key new developments and ongoing trends:\n\n**1. AI-Driven Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Unraveling complex biological pathways:** AI algorithms are becoming incredibly adept at analyzing massive datasets, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and clinical trial data. This allows them to identify novel biological targets (e.g., specific proteins or genes) that play a critical role in disease pathogenesis, which might have been overlooked by traditional methods.\n*   **Predicting target druggability:** AI can assess the likelihood that a particular target can be modulated by a small molecule or biologic drug, saving significant time and resources on targets that are unlikely to yield therapeutic results.\n\n**2. Accelerated Molecule Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **De novo drug design:** Generative AI models (like GANs and VAEs) are not just screening existing compounds; they are *designing* entirely new molecules from scratch. These AI-generated molecules are optimized for specific properties, such as binding affinity to the target, bioavailability, and reduced toxicity.\n*   **Virtual screening on an unprecedented scale:** AI can screen billions of virtual compounds against a target much faster and more efficiently than traditional high-throughput screening (HTS) methods. This dramatically expands the chemical space that can be explored.\n*   **Predicting drug properties:** AI models can accurately predict various drug properties, including ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity), solubility, and stability, helping to filter out unpromising candidates early on.\n\n**3. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding new uses for old drugs:** AI can analyze vast amounts of data to identify existing approved drugs that might be effective against new or different diseases. This significantly shortens the development timeline and reduces costs, as safety profiles are already established.\n*   **Identifying unexpected drug combinations:** AI can uncover synergistic drug combinations for treating complex diseases, where the combination is more effective than either drug alone.\n\n**4. Enhancing Clinical Trial Design and Success:**\n\n*   **Predicting clinical trial outcomes:** AI can analyze preclinical data and early clinical trial results to predict the likelihood of success for later-stage trials, helping to de-risk investments.\n*   **Optimizing patient selection:** AI can identify specific patient subgroups who are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Identifying potential adverse events:** AI can analyze real-world data and clinical trial data to proactively identify potential safety concerns before they become widespread.\n\n**5. Advancements in Specific Disease Areas:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** AI is making significant strides in identifying cancer targets, designing personalized cancer therapies, and predicting treatment response.\n*   **Neurodegenerative diseases:** AI is being used to identify biomarkers for early detection and to design drugs that can cross the blood-brain barrier.\n*   **Infectious diseases:** AI is accelerating the discovery of novel antibiotics and antivirals, especially crucial in light of rising antimicrobial resistance.\n\n**Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **AI-first drug discovery companies:** Numerous startups and established pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI capabilities, often partnering with AI technology providers.\n*   **\"Closed-loop\" discovery:** The ultimate goal for some is a fully integrated AI system where AI designs, synthesizes, tests, and learns from the results in a continuous cycle.\n*   **Focus on rare diseases and unmet needs:** AI's ability to efficiently explore vast possibilities makes it particularly well-suited for tackling rare diseases where traditional drug development has been challenging.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges persist, including the need for high-quality, curated data, the interpretability of complex AI models, and navigating the regulatory landscape for AI-discovered drugs.\n\nIn summary, AI is fundamentally transforming drug discovery by making it faster, more efficient, and more targeted.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
